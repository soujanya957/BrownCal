This is our Hack@brown README.

Our project is called BrownStop. It uses Selenium and BeautifulSoup to extract data from Courses@Brown related to student's classes and
transcripts. It then creates Calendar events on the student's BrownU account to keep track of student's busy schedule. All student related information is stored within an interactive website that allows you to track the classes you have taken, and the ones you still have to take for your concentration.
